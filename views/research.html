WASP-47 <br><br>

Using new data from the K2 mission, we show that WASP-47, a previously known hot Jupiter host, also hosts two additional transiting planets: a Neptune-sized outer planet and a super-Earth inner companion. We measure planetary properties from the K2 light curve and detect transit timing variations, confirming the planetary nature of the outer planet. We performed a large number of numerical simulations to study the dynamical stability of the system and to find the theoretically expected transit timing variations (TTVs). The theoretically predicted TTVs are in good agreement with those observed (which are available here), and we use the TTVs to determine the masses of two planets, and place a limit on the third. The WASP-47 planetary system is important because companion planets can both be inferred by TTVs and are also detected directly through transit observations. The depth of the hot Jupiter's transits make ground-based TTV measurements possible, and the brightness of the host star makes it amenable for precise radial velocity measurements. The system serves as a Rosetta Stone for understanding TTVs as a planet detection technique.<br><br>



I am interested in the origins of planets - both in and out of clusters. Very broadly, I am interested in planet formation. In the past, I have worked with Dr. Konstantin Batygin on determining constraints on interior structure for a transiting planet based on its orbital elements, which is applicable to particular set of orbital architectures. Currently, I am interested in multi-planet occurance in and out of clusters. I am currently working with Fred Adams on this topic. <br><br>

I am interested in exploring clusters, binarity, and the properties of stars. With Dr. John Johnson, I performed a A- and B-type star binarity survey using legacy Keck HIRES calibration data. This work is in preparation for publication now. I have also worked with Dr. Philip Muirhead on a variety of projects including characterization of an interesting white dwarf, M-dwarf binary and a spectroscopic survey of KOI targets. <br><br>
