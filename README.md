Key files for future changes:

  * index.html - contains the heavy lifting of the code
  * assets/css/style.css - contains the custom formatting for this page 
  * views/...html - the different views; update text for the different 
                    sections here
  * MainController.js - the routing for the different subsections; if you 
                    want to add additional sections make sure to 
                    add relevant code for routing here, following the format
                    of the other links (<a> tags in index.html)
